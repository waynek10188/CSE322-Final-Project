					<p> The Toyota Cressida is a mid-size car that was manufactured by Toyota 
					from December 1976 until 1992 through four generations. 
					Cressida was the export version of the Toyota Mark II sold in Japan. </p>
					<p> Spanning through four generations, the Toyota Cressida was one of the 
					most luxurious Japanese cars of it's time. Through the years various engines were
					used throughout the years. Although the most prominent were the series of Inline-6
					engines used  to power these cars. They were so smooth and refined that it was easily
					considered a flagship sedan. The Cressida is one of the main influences for the brand 
					known as Lexus which is a subsidary maker for Toyota. Sadly, the Cressida was phased out
					when Lexus came about in 1989 and eventually discontinued in 1992 after four generations, the last
					of which shared the same non-turbo 7M-GE Inline-6 with the Mark III Toyota Supra</p>

			<h2>Trivia Cressida:</h2>
			<p>Despite being a four-door sedan, the Cressida is a popular drift car 
			in the modern day. This is due to its ease of modifications and being a 
			rear-wheel drive front-engined layout.
