					<p> The AE86 generation of the Toyota Corolla Levin and Toyota Sprinter Trueno is a small,
					lightweight coupe or hatchback introduced by Toyota in 1983 as part of the fifth generation Toyota Corolla lineup.
					The AE86 was available with a fuel-injected 4-cylinder twin-cam 1587 cc 4A-GE engine in Japan and Europe 
					which was also used in the first-generation Toyota MR2. In North America, a modified 4A-GEC engine was
					used to comply with California emissions regulations</p>
					<p> During its production life, the AE86 was a popular choice for showroom stock, Group A, and Group N racing,
					especially in rallying and circuit races. Even after production of the car was discontinued, many privateer teams
					still raced the AE86, and it is still a popular choice for rallying and club races today. 
					Part of the continued appeal of the AE86 for motorsports is its rear-drive configuration,
					a feature not available in most newer lightweight coupes. The main character of the anime and manga Initial D, Takumi Fujiwara,
					uses his father's AE86 Trueno apex hatchback for racing and making his tofu deliveries.

					<p> Toyota introduced the first-generation MR2 in 1984, designating it the model code "W10".
					When fitted with the 1.5-liter 3A engine, it was known as the "AW10". Likewise, the 1.6-liter 4A version is identified by the "AW11" code.
					At its introduction in 1984, the MR2 won the Car of the Year Japan. </p>
					<p> The car uses a Mid-Engined Rear-Wheel drive layout. In 1986 (1988 for the US market), Toyota introduced a supercharged engine for the MR2.
					Based on the same block and head, the 4A-GZE was equipped with a small Roots-type supercharger and a Denso intercooler.
					This increased the horsepower of the car while still keeping a relatively small weight just over a ton and a quarter.
